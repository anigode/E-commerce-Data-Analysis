# E-commerce Sales Demand Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing data from an e-commerce platform to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and overall business performance. The dataset includes information such as customer transactions, product details, purchase amounts, and timestamps. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project identifies key trends and patterns that can help improve decision-making in an e-commerce environment.

## Business Problem
An e-commerce company faces challenges in managing product inventory across multiple categories and regions. They want to:
- Predict future product demand
- Reduce overstock and stockouts
- Improve category-wise and region-wise sales strategies
## Objective
- Perform sales forecasting using ARIMA
- Analyze category and region-based performance
- Identify high/low-performing SKUs
- Build Power BI dashboards for decision-makers
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide insights into customer transactions and business performance by analyzing various aspects of e-commerce data. The project focuses on understanding customer behavior, identifying sales patterns, and providing data-driven recommendations to enhance marketing strategies, inventory management, and overall operational efficiency.
## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Install the required libraries.
- Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.6 or above).
## Usage
- Place your e-commerce dataset (e.g., ecommerce_data.csv) in the project directory.
- Run the data analysis script (e.g., ecommerce_analysis.py) to perform the analysis and generate insights.
- The output will include data visualizations, statistical summaries, and key business metrics.
## Data
The project uses an e-commerce dataset that contains various types of information:
- Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- Product ID: Unique identifier for each product.
- Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Purchase Amount: Total amount spent in each transaction.
- Timestamp: Date and time of the transaction.
Key data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Converting timestamps into useful formats for time-based analysis
- Aggregating data to understand sales trends by product, customer, and time period
## Analysis
The data analysis focuses on several key areas:
- Sales Trends: Identifying high-performing products, peak sales periods, and revenue growth over time.
- Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on purchase behavior to identify high-value customers and develop targeted marketing strategies.
- Product Performance: Analyzing which products contribute the most to revenue and identifying underperforming products.
- Time-Based Analysis: Understanding how sales vary across different days, weeks, or seasons to improve inventory planning and promotions.
## Evaluation
The success of the analysis is evaluated based on:
- Sales Insights: Key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and product performance.
- Customer Behavior: Patterns in repeat purchases, customer lifetime value, and segmentation.
- Time-based Trends: Identification of seasonal trends and high-demand periods.
## Libraries
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
